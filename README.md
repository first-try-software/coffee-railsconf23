# The Coffee Machine - Tropical.rb 2024 Edition

This repository was first developed as a companion to our RubyConf Mini 2022 presentation entitled, "A Brewer's Guide to Filtering out Complexity and Churn". It was later extended to accompany our longer RailsConf 2023 talk of the same name.

The goal of the talk is to show people how to remove the bitterness caused by complexity and churn from their applications.

In it, we demonstrate:

* How complexity sneaks into a code base;
* How to recognize complexity before it becomes painful; and,
* How to remove it permanently.

The code in this repository was used in the creation of the slides for the talk. We felt it was important to publish the code so that folks could walk through each commit with us and with actual tests (since there wasn't enough time or screen real estate to cover them the tests during the talk).

Thanks for stopping by!
